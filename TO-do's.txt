TO-do's:

- servo detach i.e. make the thing silent went not needing to hold the position
- eliminate many delay's
- split in automatic and manual mode
	- BUILTIN_LED should indicate mode
	- FLASH_BUTTON should toggle automatic and manual mode
	- automatic:
		- water the plant based on soil moist
- UI
	- multiple screens
	- regular period
		- alternate screens
	- Watering indicator (finish printWater() function)
- last time since watering
- soil measure timer (evaluate finished?)

- ALWAYS:
	- read pressure
	- read temperature
	- read light level (percentile?)
	- read soil moisture (percentile?)

- MQTT
	- regulary (in seperate topics)
		- publish temperature
		- publish light level
		- publish soil moisture
	- subcripe to topic ot water plant manually (command)
	- subcripe to sensor topic (retrieve values!)
	- sub and pub automatic/manual mode
	- LastWill + retain flag for online status
	- reconnecting (maybe persistent session)
	- test with diagnostic mqtt (explorer) client ?? 

- NODE-red
	- gauges
	- graphs
	- issue command to plant (is there, but test with thing)
	- update sensor values (force update sensors)
	- online status thingy on dashboard

- MQTT APP
	- duplicate node-red dashboard functionality

- Gesture elicitation
	- Node-red plugin for gesture stuff
	- 

- VIDEO WALKTHROUGH 3-5 min
	- film the thing
		- watering the plant
		- explain 3d print build
		- explain mounting
		- show custom planned wiring
		- stop-motion build?
	- node-red
		- briefly touch over all measurements
		- show functionality (controls)
	- App
		- show app interacting with the thing
	- Gesture
		- show gesture activating the thing

- REPORT
	- 

- CODE
 - remove sensitive data from skectch
 - remove sensitive data from NODE_RED
 - gesture code (ez)


Maybe To-Do's
- Add button, and debounce it
	- force scroll UI or water
- water the plant based on LDR and pressure too (amount)
- Try wifimanager again?
